        "artist_description": "QWER is a rising star in the pop-rock music scene in South Korea. Their roster is stacked with social media personalities and a former member of a Japanese idol group, but don't let that fool you. Their music is energetic and fun, and it is amazing to watch how quickly each of the members are honing their craft."

Whether it is a longing sadness or an exhilarating rush, her ability to imbue emotions in her voice is absolutely incredible, you'll have to hear it for yourself to understand."
